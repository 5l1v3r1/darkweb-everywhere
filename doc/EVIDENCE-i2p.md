# The Evidence
The purpose of this document is to attempt to provide proof that each eepsite linked to in these sets of rules, is actually the real thing and not simply an attempt to redirect you to a hostile site.
While this list is in no means perfect, it is at least an attempt.

Everyone is encouraged to add more evidence!

## Qualifications
* A link from a site associated with the respective service saying that the link is legitimate.
* Ideally, each domain should have multiple sources confirming that each eepsite is legitimate.

## The Links
Links marked with "TODO" are links that have not been proven as the hidden version of a clearnet site.
