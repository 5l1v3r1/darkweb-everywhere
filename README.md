# Darknet Rulesets

These [HTTPS Everywhere][0] rulesets can be used to automatically connect to the hidden service equivalent of some popular sites.
Some of these are for i2p eepsites, and some are for tor hidden services.
To use these, you must use the [tor browser bundle][1] or have i2p installed.

## Instillation

To install, put the rulesets you want in `~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules/`.
