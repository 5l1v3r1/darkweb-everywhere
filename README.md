# Darkweb Rulesets

These [HTTPS Everywhere][0] rulesets can be used to automatically connect to the hidden service equivalent of some popular sites.
Some of these are for i2p eepsites, and some are for tor hidden services.
To use these, you must use the [tor browser bundle][1] or have i2p installed.

If you have any to add I would appreciate contributions!

## Installation

To install, put the rulesets you want in `~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules/`.

There's a basic script for \*nix users to install.
Just run, `./install.sh`.

## Contributing

HTTPSEverywhere has a good [guide][2] to make rules.
The only difference is, make sure the name is appended with "Onion".

## Disclaimer

I do not vouch or endorse any of these sites.
I just supply these so everyone has more privacy.
