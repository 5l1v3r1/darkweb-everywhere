{"name":"Darkweb Everywhere","tagline":"HTTPS Everywhere rulesets for hidden services and eepsites.","body":"# Darkweb Rulesets\r\n\r\nDarkweb-Everywhere is a fork of [HTTPS Everywhere][0] that in addition to the normal HTTPS Everywhere functionality, will redirect you to the hidden service equvalent of a website if present. \r\nFor this extention to work, you should be using installing it inside the [Tor Browser Bundle][1].\r\n\r\nAn example of a hidden service redirect would be:\r\n\r\n    <https://duckduckgo.com> will be redirected to <http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion>\r\n\r\n## Sites Included\r\n\r\n* [Facebook](https://facebook.com)\r\n* [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com)\r\n* [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info)\r\n* [Cryptocat](https://crypto.cat)\r\n* [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press)\r\n* [Lots of SecureDrop instances](https://freedom.press/securedrop/directory)\r\n* And many more\r\n\r\n## Why is this needed?\r\n\r\nDue to the way Tor works, when you connect to sites which are not hidden services you must connect through an exit node.\r\nThis exit node is able to see which sites are being connected to.\r\nBy having the hidden service loaded instead of the clearnet URL, you make your entire connection without leaving the Tor network.\r\n\r\nA good explanation of what Tor hidden services are and how they work can be found [here][2].\r\n\r\n## How can I trust you?\r\n\r\nIn the files [doc/EVIDENCE.md](doc/EVIDENCE.md) and [doc/EVIDENCE-i2p.md](doc/EVIDENCE-i2p.md) you can find the source where each address is documented.\r\nIf there is no proof for the address, the rule will stay under unverified-rules folder until proper documentation is found.\r\nThe code and commit history are also freely available for anyone to audit.\r\n\r\nIf you see any discrepancies please make it known by filing an issue.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n0. If you haven't already, download the [Tor Browser Bundle][9]\r\n1. Start up the Tor Browser Bundle\r\n2. Download [the extension][5]\r\n3. Drag the downloaded extension into the Tor Browser Bundle's [Addons page][6].\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThe developers do not vouch for, endorse, approve, disapprove, or renounce of any of these sites.\r\nThese are supplied for our users, so that they have more privacy. \r\n\r\nDarkweb-everywhere, the extension, and the developers of darkweb-everywhere are not affiliated with the EFF in any way, shape or form.\r\n## Thank you!\r\n\r\nA **BIG** thank you to the EFF and all the many contributors to HTTPS Everywhere\r\nAnother **BIG** thank you to The Tor Project and all the contributors that help with Tor.\r\nWithout either of these two organizations, darkweb-everywhere would not exist.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere \"HTTPS Everywhere\"\r\n[1]: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en \"The Tor Browser Bundle\"\r\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAxBuckgPuU#t=17\r\n[3]: https://github.com/chris-barry/darkweb-everywhere/archive/master.zip\r\n[4]: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets \"HTTPS Everywhere Rulesets\"\r\n[5]: https://github.com/chris-barry/darkweb-everywhere/releases\r\n[6]: about:addons\r\n[7]: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1670\r\n[8]: https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032220.html\r\n[9]: https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
