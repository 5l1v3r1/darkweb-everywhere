# TODO
Just a simple TODO list of possible ideas, bugfixes, etc. 

## Possible Features
* Tails support. 
  * Maybe a prompt in the script asking the user if they are using Tails or not is the least painful way of doing this. I (colin) will do some testing over my upcoming break to see if one can modify Tails' HTTPS Everywhere rules without needing the user to put in a password.
  * 2014-03-17 -- I will ask in the IRC room at some point where exactly the HTTPS Everywhere rules are stored. Initial suspicions point to it being pulled from the torproject's git page, rather than it being stored locally. 
	* 2014-05-02 -- I completely forgot that this was on my TODO. I plan on making some more progress after this semester is over in ~10 days. 
* Windows installer?
* More evidence.
* Check rules that are `default_off`.
* Improve `install.sh`.
* More i2p addresses.

## Bugs
* None so far!
